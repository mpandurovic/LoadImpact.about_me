# LoadImpact.about_me

Hey everyone! My name is Marko and I'm a new member of Load Impact. Here are a few things about me:

## Some personal info

* 29 years old.
* Born and raised in Belgrade, Serbia.
* Studied Software Engineering at the University of Belgrade. 

## My previous work experience

* Been coding for 6+ years.
* Started as a `Java` developer and experiemented with a lot of platforms/stacks/languages (`Java`, `Spring`, `Play`, `Scala`, `Android`, `AngularJS`... just to name a few).
* More recently: `Python`, `JavaScript`, `Django`, `Node.js`, `React`.
* For a larger part of my career, I worked as a back-end developer but after discovering `React` and working with it, it re-ignited my interest in front-end (still a newbie in the area, but I give it my best). Now, I try to stay in touch with both worlds.

## Fun facts

* I am and always have been a geek.
* Living with my girlfriend for about 2 years, been together for 7.
* Switched from medical school to engineering. One of the best choices I made in my life (was pretty bad at the former) :)
* Caught a drumstick at my favorite band's concert (the first and only time I heard them live).
* Almost fell down a water drain as a kid. Luckily, it wasn't Pennywise that pulled me in.
* Learned English almost entirely by playing video games.
* Bad at starting conversations but can talk hours about random stuff if given a beer.
* Yes, I love beer.

## Hobbies and interests:

* Coding (duh) - I tinker from time to time.
* Traveling - Been to a few places.
* Sports - Football and basketball. Used to play for fun. Was pretty bad at both. Now I just watch on TV from time to time (and sometimes in person).
* Reading - Mostly epic fantasy, sci-fi, horror. First Law, Mistborn, Hyperion, Lord of the Rings...
* Movies/TV shows - Pretty much the same genres as books but I enjoy other stuff, too. Game of Thrones, Star Wars, MCU, The Walking Dead, Stranger Things etc.
* Board games - I don't play that often, but I enjoy immensely.
* Memes - I should probably stahp.
